## About Pipeliner
Pipeliner provides access to some of the NGS data analysis pipelines used by CCBR on the NIH Biowulf Linux Cluster. The program provides a graphical interface for configuring and executing NGS workflows.

Pipeliner is designed to work on NIH Biowulf Linux Cluster with its prerequisite software (i.e.Snakemake, slurm, component software and others).

At this time, support can only be provided for those who have access to NIH Biowulf Linux Cluster. More details can be obtained by going to CCBR's GitHub [page](https://github.com/CCBR/Pipeliner).

At the current moment, we are accepting ideas for additions to be made to Pipeliner. We would love to hear your feedback!
